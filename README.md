# SQL-Employee-Tracker
My modivation for creating this was to be able to create an interactive terminal while also seeing how to utilizes the seeds.sql and the schema.sql. What I learned in this project was how to properly seed information into a database and be able to custimize it to my likeing. Doing this showed me how I could populate information with out hard codeing it over and over again. One of the main problems I ran into in this project was creating the server.js file. This was due to the creating the pathway so the information could go in the correct location.
